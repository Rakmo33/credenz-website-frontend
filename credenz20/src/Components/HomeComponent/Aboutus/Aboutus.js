                <h3>Credenz</h3>
            <p>Credenz is the annual technical festival organised by the PICT IEEE Student Branch. 
            Started in 2004, with a view to elicit the best out of each and every one, it has grown to
             become one of the finest technical events in Pune. Credenz aims not only to infuse a competitive 
             spirit among participants, but also widen their horizons in the ever-changing field of technology
              via myriad seminars and workshops. <br/>
             Participants get a chance to discover their talents and thrive in numerous events like Clash,
             B Plan, RoboLIGA, WebWeaver, Pixelate, Cretronix, Paper Presentation and DataWiz. This is a
              unique chance for the students to go beyond the traditional spheres of academics and make the most
               of their potential. This spirit of learning and discovery has inspired the PICT IEEE Student Branch 
               to present Credenz , a podium for you to nurture and cultivate your talents.</p>

              being conducted in odd semester and the latter one in even semester. PISB is also marked by
